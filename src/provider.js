// The Tinycast root-search provider for TMDB movies and TV shows. Bundled to a single self-contained
// file that AppCore loads into a resident JavaScriptCore session.
//
// The index is NOT committed — it is rebuilt every day, so it ships as a GitHub Release asset beside a
// small manifest and per-day deltas. The manifest is fetched every launch and an index file only when
// its recorded hash changed, so a launch costs one small request and a day's update only that day's
// delta. The store (every record, ~140 MB compressed) ships as a third asset for base rebuilds.
//
// A provider's API surface is restricted to `rootSearch.*` + `open`, but the Node builtins are
// provided to every bundle by design — so the index is downloaded with curl through the process shim.
// That streams straight to disk, which the fetch path cannot: its polyfill is refused by the provider
// bridge, and a bare `fetch` only works where JavaScriptCore supplies a native one, buffering the
// whole body in memory. That, plus the resident-session runtime, makes this Tinycast-only: it is not a
// Raycast extension and must stay out of the Raycast store and any registry catalog.
//
// `@tinycast/api` exposes only `registerRootSearchProvider` and `open`, so `environment.supportPath` is
// out of reach and the host hands the cache directory over in the environment instead — already scoped
// by bundle id, so a Dev build's index never collides with an installed copy's. A re-downloadable,
// hash-verified artifact belongs in Caches rather than Application Support, and the host decides that;
// this file only has to be told where it is.
//
// The default export must stay "alive" (return a never-settling promise) so the resident session keeps
// the runtime mounted across keystrokes — see RootSearchProviderHost.
