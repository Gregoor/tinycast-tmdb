// The Tinycast root-search provider for Wikipedia: English, German and Spanish.
//
// The artifact contract is the movie provider's — a hash-verified index in the cache the host hands
// over, synced from a manifest, searched through the shared loader and ranker — so this file is the
// whole difference between the two. What it does not reuse: the ratings preference (Wikipedia rows
// have no scores) and `provider-core`, which composes movie-specific subtitles.
//
// One index per language, each with its own cache directory and manifest. That keeps a language's band
// its own decision — English can be 100 MB while Spanish is 20 — and it is what the index format
// needs anyway: a row's media-type bit is one bit, so the language cannot live inside it. The search
// already merges a list of indexes, which is how base + deltas work.
//
// The manifests are local while this is a prototype. `syncIndexes` cannot tell the difference — it
// fetches a URL, checks a hash, and installs — so pointing these at release assets is a one-line change
// once there are any.
